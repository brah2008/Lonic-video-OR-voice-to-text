# Lonic-video-OR-voice-to-text
Lonic creation application mobile android to do (video or voice) to text with Ionic

To create a mobile application for Android that converts videos or voice to text using Ionic, you could follow these steps:

1 - Set up the Ionic environment by installing Ionic CLI, Node.js, and Cordova.

2 - Create a new Ionic project using the Ionic CLI. You can use the following command to create a new project:

```csharp
ionic start myApp blank
```





2 - Add the required plugins to support video and audio recording. For example, you can use the Cordova Media plugin for audio recording and the Cordova Camera plugin for video recording.

3 - Implement the UI for recording videos or audio in your Ionic application. You can use Ionic UI components such as buttons and modals to implement the recording feature.

4 - Write the logic to convert the recorded video or audio to text. You can use a speech-to-text API such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to perform the conversion.

5 - Finally, you can test the application on an emulator or a physical device to verify that it works as expected.

This is a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating a mobile application that converts videos or voice to text using Ionic. The specific implementation details may vary based on your requirements and the plugins you use.




#  Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can convert the recorded audio to text using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:
```typescript


import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Media, MediaObject } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  private mediaObject: MediaObject;
  transcription: string;

  constructor(private media: Media, private http: HttpClient) {}

  startRecording() {
    this.mediaObject = this.media.create('file.amr');
    this.mediaObject.startRecord();
  }

  stopRecording() {
    this.mediaObject.stopRecord();
    const file = this.mediaObject.getNativeUrl();

    this.http.post('https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize', {
      config: {
        encoding: 'AMR',
        sampleRateHertz: 8000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: file,
      },
    }).subscribe(response => {
      this.transcription = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript;
    });
  }
}

```

Note that you will need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console and include it in the API request to access the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

This code demonstrates how you can make an HTTP POST request to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, passing the recorded audio and the required configuration parameters as the request body. The response from the API contains the transcribed text, which can be displayed in the UI of your Ionic application.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details.



#  Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can display the transcribed text in the UI of your Ionic application:


```php

<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      Video/Audio to Text Conversion
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content padding>
  <ion-button (click)="startRecording()">Start Recording</ion-button>
  <ion-button (click)="stopRecording()">Stop Recording</ion-button>
  <ion-textarea [value]="transcription" readonly></ion-textarea>
</ion-content>

```

This code snippet demonstrates how you can display the transcribed text in a textarea in the UI of your Ionic application. The textarea is bound to the **transcription** property, which is set in the TypeScript code after the API call to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details.



#  Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can record video or voice using the Ionic Native Media plugin:



```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Media, MediaObject } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  private mediaObject: MediaObject;

  constructor(private media: Media) {}

  startRecording() {
    this.mediaObject = this.media.create('file.amr');
    this.mediaObject.startRecord();
  }

  stopRecording() {
    this.mediaObject.stopRecord();
  }
}

```


This code demonstrates how you can use the Ionic Native Media plugin to record audio or video in your Ionic application. The **create** method creates a new **MediaObject** instance and the **startRecord** method starts recording the audio or video. The **stopRecord** method stops the recording and saves it to the specified file.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details.


#  Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can install and import the required dependencies in your Ionic application:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { IonicModule } from '@ionic/angular';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Media } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HomePage } from './home/home.page';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HomePage],
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(), HttpClientModule],
  providers: [Media],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}


```


This code demonstrates how you can install and import the required dependencies in your Ionic application. The **HttpClientModule** and **Media** dependencies are imported and added to the **providers** array in the module definition.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details.


**--** Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can send the recorded audio or video to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API and receive the transcribed text:

```typescript

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  private transcription: string;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  transcribe(file: Blob) {
    const url = 'https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=YOUR_API_KEY';
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    });
    const body = {
      config: {
        encoding: 'AMR',
        sampleRateHertz: 8000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: file.toString('base64'),
      },
    };
    this.http.post(url, body, { headers }).subscribe((res) => {
      this.transcription = res['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript'];
    });
  }
}


```

This code demonstrates how you can send the recorded audio or video file to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API using the **HttpClient** module from the Angular framework. The **transcribe** method takes a **Blob** object as input, which represents the recorded audio or video file. The method sends a **POST** request to the API endpoint with the necessary headers and request body. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains the transcribed text, which is then assigned to the **transcription** property.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details. Don't forget to replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with your own API key for the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.


#  Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how you can display the transcribed text in your Ionic application:

```php
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      Transcription
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-header>
      Transcription
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      {{ transcription }}
    </ion-card-content>
  </ion-card>
</ion-content>

```

This code demonstrates how you can display the transcribed text in your Ionic application using Angular's two-way data binding feature. The **transcription** property from the component is bound to the template using the double curly braces syntax, which means that the value of the **transcription** property will be displayed in the template.

This code is just a starting point, and you will need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and implementation details.


#  Here are some additional steps that you may need to take in order to get this code working in your Ionic application:

1- Install the required dependencies:

```java
npm install @ionic-native/media
npm install @angular/common/http
```
2- Add your API key to the URL in the **transcribe** method:

```rust
const url = 'https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=YOUR_API_KEY';
```
3- Add the plugins to your **app.module.ts** file:
```python
import { Media } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(), HttpClientModule],
  providers: [Media],
  ...
})
export class AppModule {}

```
4- Add the recording and transcription functionality to your **home.page.ts** file:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Media, MediaObject } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  private transcription: string;
  private file: MediaObject;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private media: Media) {}

  startRecording() {
    this.file = this.media.create('recording.amr');
    this.file.startRecord();
  }

  stopRecording() {
    this.file.stopRecord();
    this.file.getBlob().then((blob) => {
      this.transcribe(blob);
    });
  }

  transcribe(file: Blob) {
    const url = 'https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=YOUR_API_KEY';
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    });
    const body = {
      config: {
        encoding: 'AMR',
        sampleRateHertz: 8000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: file.toString('base64'),
      },
    };
    this.http.post(url, body, { headers }).subscribe((res) => {
      this.transcription = res['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript'];
    });
  }
}

```

#  Here is an example of how you could integrate the transcribed text into your Ionic application.

1- In your home.page.html file, you can display the transcription as follows:


```php
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      Transcription
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-header>
      Record
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      <ion-button (click)="startRecording()">Start</ion-button>
      <ion-button (click)="stopRecording()">Stop</ion-button>
    </ion-card-content>
  </ion-card>
  <ion-card>
    <ion-card-header>
      Transcription
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      {{ transcription }}
    </ion-card-content>
  </ion-card>
</ion-content>

```
2- In your **home.page.ts** file, you can update the transcription property with the **transcribed** text:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Media, MediaObject } from '@ionic-native/media/ngx';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.page.html',
  styleUrls: ['home.page.scss'],
})
export class HomePage {
  private transcription: string;
  private file: MediaObject;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient, private media: Media) {}

  startRecording() {
    this.file = this.media.create('recording.amr');
    this.file.startRecord();
  }

  stopRecording() {
    this.file.stopRecord();
    this.file.getBlob().then((blob) => {
      this.transcribe(blob);
    });
  }

  transcribe(file: Blob) {
    const url = 'https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=YOUR_API_KEY';
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    });
    const body = {
      config: {
        encoding: 'AMR',
        sampleRateHertz: 8000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: file.toString('base64'),
      },
    };
    this.http.post(url, body, { headers }).subscribe((res) => {
      this.transcription = res['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript'];
    });
  }
}

```
With these changes, your application should display the transcribed text after recording a video or voice message.


#  The code I have provided previously is a high-level overview of how you can transcribe speech to text using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API. However, I can provide you with more detailed information and examples.

Here is a more in-depth example of the **transcribe** function in the **home.page.ts** file:

```css
transcribe(file: Blob) {
  const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
  const url = `https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize?key=${apiKey}`;

  const headers = new HttpHeaders({
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  });

  const body = {
    config: {
      encoding: 'AMR',
      sampleRateHertz: 8000,
      languageCode: 'en-US',
    },
    audio: {
      content: file.toString('base64'),
    },
  };

  this.http.post(url, body, { headers }).subscribe((response) => {
    if (response && response['results'] && response['results'][0] && response['results'][0]['alternatives']) {
      this.transcription = response['results'][0]['alternatives'][0]['transcript'];
    } else {
      console.error('Error transcribing audio');
    }
  }, (error) => {
    console.error('Error transcribing audio:', error);
  });
}

```
This example is more thorough in terms of error handling and ensures that the response from the API contains the necessary data before updating the **transcription** property.

Additionally, I recommend that you replace **'YOUR_API_KEY'** with your own Google Cloud API key. You can obtain a key by following the instructions in the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API documentation.


#  To add a UI for recording and playing audio in your Ionic app, you can create a new component that contains buttons for starting and stopping the recording, and for playing the recorded audio.

Here is an example of a component that you can use for this purpose:
```kotlin
import { Component, ElementRef, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-audio-recorder',
  template: `
    <ion-buttons>
      <ion-button (click)="startRecording()" [disabled]="isRecording">
        <ion-icon name="mic"></ion-icon>
      </ion-button>
      <ion-button (click)="stopRecording()" [disabled]="!isRecording">
        <ion-icon name="square"></ion-icon>
      </ion-button>
      <ion-button (click)="playAudio()" [disabled]="isRecording || !audioBlob">
        <ion-icon name="play"></ion-icon>
      </ion-button>
    </ion-buttons>
    <audio #audioElement [src]="audioUrl"></audio>
  `,
  styles: [`
    ion-buttons {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
    }
  `],
})
export class AudioRecorderComponent {
  @ViewChild('audioElement') audioElement: ElementRef<HTMLAudioElement>;

  audioBlob: Blob;
  audioUrl: string;
  isRecording = false;

  startRecording() {
    this.isRecording = true;
    // Code for starting the recording goes here
  }

  stopRecording() {
    this.isRecording = false;
    // Code for stopping the recording and creating the audioBlob goes here
  }

  playAudio() {
    this.audioElement.nativeElement.play();
  }
}

```


This component contains three buttons: one for starting the recording, one for stopping the recording, and one for playing the recorded **audio**. The buttons are disabled or enabled based on the state of the recording process. The component also includes an audio element that you can use to play the recorded audio.

You can integrate this component into your **home.page.html** file by adding the following code:
```php
<ion-header>
  <ion-toolbar>
    <ion-title>
      Audio Recorder
    </ion-title>
  </ion-toolbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content>
  <app-audio-recorder></app-audio-recorder>
</ion-content>

```

This code adds the **AudioRecorderComponent** to the **home** page. You can customize the appearance and functionality of the component as needed.


#  To transcribe the audio to text, you will need to use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service. There are several third-party ASR services available, such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Amazon Transcribe, or IBM Watson Speech to Text.

Here's an example of how you can use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-audio-transcription',
  template: `
    <ion-button (click)="transcribeAudio()">Transcribe</ion-button>
    <p>{{ transcription }}</p>
  `,
})
export class AudioTranscriptionComponent {
  transcription = '';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  transcribeAudio() {
    // Make a request to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
    this.http.post<any>('https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize', {
      config: {
        encoding: 'LINEAR16',
        sampleRateHertz: 16000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: this.audioBlob.base64(),
      },
    }).subscribe(response => {
      // Extract the transcription from the API response
      this.transcription = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript;
    });
  }
}

```

Note that this is just an example of how to use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio. You will need to create a Google Cloud account and obtain an API key to use this service, and you may also need to make modifications to this code to suit your specific needs. Additionally, there may be usage limits and costs associated with using a third-party ASR service, so be sure to familiarize yourself with the terms of service and pricing before using it in your app.



# Here is a more detailed example of the code you would need to transcribe audio to text using Ionic and the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <ion-header>
      <ion-toolbar>
        <ion-title>
          Audio Transcription
        </ion-title>
      </ion-toolbar>
    </ion-header>
    <ion-content>
      <ion-button (click)="startRecording()">Start Recording</ion-button>
      <ion-button (click)="stopRecording()">Stop Recording</ion-button>
      <ion-button (click)="transcribeAudio()">Transcribe</ion-button>
      <p>{{ transcription }}</p>
    </ion-content>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  transcription = '';
  audioBlob: Blob;

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  startRecording() {
    // Code to start recording audio
    // ...
  }

  stopRecording() {
    // Code to stop recording audio and create a Blob of the recorded audio
    // ...
    this.audioBlob = new Blob(this.recordedChunks, { type: 'audio/webm' });
  }

  transcribeAudio() {
    // Make a request to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
    this.http.post<any>('https://speech.googleapis.com/v1/speech:recognize', {
      config: {
        encoding: 'LINEAR16',
        sampleRateHertz: 16000,
        languageCode: 'en-US',
      },
      audio: {
        content: this.audioBlob.base64(),
      },
    }).subscribe(response => {
      // Extract the transcription from the API response
      this.transcription = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript;
    });
  }
}

```

In this code, you have three buttons: one to start recording, one to stop recording, and one to transcribe the audio. When the "Start Recording" button is clicked, it will start recording audio. When the "Stop Recording" button is clicked, it will stop recording and create a Blob of the recorded audio. Finally, when the "Transcribe" button is clicked, it will make a request to the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the audio. The transcription will be displayed in a **<p>** element on the page.

Note that the **startRecording()** and **stopRecording()** methods are not provided in this code example and will need to be implemented based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you will need to create a Google Cloud account and obtain an API key to use the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, and you may need to make modifications to this code to suit your specific needs.
  
  
  # Here is an example of how you could implement the startRecording() and stopRecording() methods:
```typescript
  startRecording() {
  const stream = new MediaStream();
  const audioTracks = stream.getAudioTracks();
  const audioTrack = audioTracks[0];
  const audioSource = new MediaDeviceInfo('default', 'microphone', 'Microphone (default)', 'microphone');
  const constraints = { audio: { deviceId: audioSource.deviceId } };

  this.recordedChunks = [];
  this.mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, { mimeType: 'audio/webm' });
  this.mediaRecorder.addEventListener('dataavailable', (event) => {
    if (event.data.size > 0) {
      this.recordedChunks.push(event.data);
    }
  });

  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)
    .then(mediaStream => {
      stream.addTrack(mediaStream.getAudioTracks()[0]);
      this.mediaRecorder.start();
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error('getUserMedia() error: ', error);
    });
}

stopRecording() {
  this.mediaRecorder.stop();
  this.audioBlob = new Blob(this.recordedChunks, { type: 'audio/webm' });
}

```

This code uses the **MediaRecorder** API to record audio and stores the recorded data in **recordedChunks** as it is being recorded. The **stopRecording()** method stops the recording and creates a Blob of the recorded audio. The **startRecording()** method uses the **getUserMedia()** method to request access to the user's microphone and starts recording audio once access is granted.

Note that this code is just one possible implementation and may need to be modified to work with your specific requirements. Also, the **MediaRecorder** API is not supported on all browsers, so you may need to check for support and implement fallbacks if necessary.
  
  
# Here is an example of how you could implement the uploadFile() method to upload the recorded audio to a server:
```typescript
  uploadFile() {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', this.audioBlob, 'recorded-audio.webm');

  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('POST', 'https://your-server.com/upload', true);
  xhr.onload = () => {
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
      console.log('File uploaded successfully');
    } else {
      console.error('File upload failed');
    }
  };
  xhr.send(formData);
}

```
 
This code uses the **FormData** and **XMLHttpRequest** APIs to send the recorded audio file to the server. The file is added to the FormData object and then sent to the server using an HTTP POST request. The onload event handler checks the status of the request and logs a success or failure message.

Again, this code is just one possible implementation and may need to be modified to work with your specific requirements. You may need to update the URL of the server and handle any errors that occur during the file upload process.

  
# Here is an example of how you could implement the convertToText() method to convert the recorded audio to text:
```typescript
 convertToText() {
  const data = new FormData();
  data.append('file', this.audioBlob, 'recorded-audio.webm');

  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('POST', 'https://your-speech-to-text-api.com/convert', true);
  xhr.onreadystatechange = () => {
    if (xhr.readyState === XMLHttpRequest.DONE && xhr.status === 200) {
      const response = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
      this.transcribedText = response.transcribedText;
    }
  };
  xhr.send(data);
}
 
```
This code uses the FormData and XMLHttpRequest APIs to send the recorded audio file to a speech-to-text API. The API should return a JSON response with the transcribed text, which is then stored in the transcribedText property.

Note that you will need to replace the URL of the speech-to-text API with the actual URL for your API. You will also need to make sure that the API returns the transcribed text in the format expected by this code, or modify the code to handle the response format of your API. Additionally, you will need to make sure that the API you are using supports audio files in the format of the recorded audio (e.g. audio/webm in this example).
  
  
#Here's an alternative approach to transcribing audio to text using the Web Speech API: 
```typescript
 transcribeAudio() {
  const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
  recognition.lang = 'en-US';
  recognition.interimResults = false;

  recognition.addEventListener('result', (event) => {
    this.transcribedText = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  });

  recognition.start();
}
 
```
 
This code uses the **webkitSpeechRecognition** object from the Web Speech API to transcribe speech to text in real-time. The **lang** property is set to specify the language to be used for recognition, and **interimResults** is set to **false** to indicate that the API should only return the final transcription result.

The **result** event is listened to and the transcribed text is stored in the **transcribedText** property. Finally, the **start()** method is called to start the recognition process.

Note that the Web Speech API is not supported by all browsers, so you may need to include a polyfill or use a different approach for older browsers. Additionally, the accuracy of the speech recognition may vary depending on the quality of the audio and the background noise level.
  
# Here's another alternative approach to transcribing audio to text using a cloud-based speech recognition API:
```typescript
  async transcribeAudio() {
  const apiKey = 'your_api_key';
  const file = new File([this.audioBlob], 'recorded-audio.webm', { type: 'audio/webm' });

  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  formData.append('api_key', apiKey);

  const response = await fetch('https://api.cloud-speech-api.com/v1/transcribe', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  });

  const transcription = await response.json();
  this.transcribedText = transcription.text;
}

```
  
This code uses the **fetch** API to send the recorded audio file to a cloud-based speech recognition API. The API requires an API key, which is passed in the request as a form parameter. The API should return the transcribed text in a JSON format, which is then stored in the **transcribedText** property.

Note that you will need to replace the API endpoint and API key with the actual values for your API. You will also need to make sure that the API returns the transcribed text in the format expected by this code, or modify the code to handle the response format of your API. Additionally, you will need to make sure that the API you are using supports audio files in the format of the recorded audio (e.g. **audio/webm** in this example).
